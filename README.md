# mlRealEstate

> My workbook while reading/working through CH2 of [Hands-On Machine Learning](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781491962282/).
> This example involves downloading housing data from California housing districts in 1990 census recordings,
> and applying supervised machine learning regression techniques in an attempt to produce a model that can predict
> the value of a housing district given a range of other attributes/features.
